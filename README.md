## Relevant Coursework

**STOR 235 &ndash; Mathematics for Data Science**

A course focused on matrix algebra and multivariable calculus, with weekly labs done in Python to gain an understanding of the use and applications of mathematical concepts in programming. Lab topics covered machine learning and optimization topics, including support vector machines, principal component analysis, and neural networks.

**STOR 320 &ndash; Introduction to Data Science**

A course providing comprehensive instruction in R and RStudio, with a focus on the full data analytics pipeline. Emphasis was placed on data acquisition, cleaning, transformation, exploratory analysis, and visualization. The course also covered principles of model building and evaluation, such as cross-validation and sensitivity/specificity, alongside best practices for communicating results effectively.

**STOR 455 &ndash; Methods of Data Analysis**

A course focused on comparing statistical approaches for data analysis. Topics included simple and multiple linear regression, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and nested F-tests. The course also explored strategies for identifying optimal models using criteria such as AIC and BIC, as well as variable selection techniques such as stepwise selection. 

## Projects

**Exploring Recency Bias and Outcome Prediction in UFC Fights**

This project represents the culmination of four months of learning within **STOR 320**. Collaborating with teammates Anna Ungerer, Meghan Leary, Jackson Pineiro, and Akshara Kolipaka, we replicated the full data analytics cycle, focusing on UFC decision judging. Our primary goal was to investigate the potential presence of recency bias in UFC judges' decision-making during three-round fights. Additionally, we aimed to identify key indicators that contribute to determining the winner of a fight using predictive modeling techniques. While UFC judging remains a complex concept, we found no evidence that judges place extra emphasis on later rounds of fights. We also found that of different categories of striking, strike location, fighter positioning, and strike significance, the location of where strikes landed was the most helpful category in correctly predicting winners. This project was done using **R** and **RStudio**, and leveraged a variety of statistical techniques and models to analyze and visualize the data.
